CROP PREDICTION AND YIELD DETECTION
A Machine Learning Model for crop 
prediction and yield detection using environmental and soil data. 
Preprocessed the dataset, trained models (e.g., Random Forest, 
Gradient Boosting), and achieved **92%  accuracy** in predictions. 
Built a web application with Flask/Django, enabling farmers to input 
parameters and receive real-time recommendations. Technologies used 
include Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplot-lib,React js.
